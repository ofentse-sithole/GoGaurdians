# GoGuardian Docs

Welcome to the documentation for the GoGuardian Expo/React Native app. This docs set focuses on the current mobile application in this repository and explains the folder layout, key files, and where to add features.

- Start here: Folder Structure → ./folder-structure.md
- App overview and tech: see the top-level README.md (kept for pitch and product context)

## What’s inside

- folder-structure.md — Up-to-date explanation of every folder and important files
- Per-folder READMEs — Brief guides inside major folders (BusinessUse, PersonalUse, components, assets)

## Contributing to docs

- Prefer short, practical descriptions over lengthy theory
- Update docs when you add, move, or rename files
- Keep examples and names consistent with the project codebase
