# GoGuardian

**One Panic Button. All Responders. Faster Help.**

GoGuardian is a **mobile-first emergency response app** built with **Expo & React Native** for South Africa. It unifies public, private, and community responders to ensure **faster help, smarter coordination, and improved safety**, especially for **gender-based violence (GBV) victims**.

---

## 🆘 Project Overview

South Africa’s emergency response system is fragmented:

* SAPS (10111), private security companies, CPFs, medical services, and NGOs operate independently.
* Victims don’t know who to call, and responders rarely coordinate.

**GoGuardian solves this**:

* **One-button panic alerts** (App + USSD)
* **AI Safety Assistant** for guidance during emergencies
* **Live location tracking & sharing**
* **Family safety dashboard**
* **Vehicle safety mode**
* **Incident reporting & evidence upload**
* **Safe route navigation**
* **Community safety alerts**

---

## 🌍 What Inspired the Project

South Africa faces high levels of **crime and gender-based violence**, and many people struggle to get help fast when danger strikes. During emergencies, **seconds can determine safety**, but response systems are often slow, uncoordinated, or confusing.

Our team realized:

* **Most people don’t know who to call in a crisis**
* SAPS, CPFs, private security, medics, and NGOs **respond separately**, not together
* **GBV survivors need both police + emotional/social support**
* Families want to **feel connected and protected**, especially when travelling at night or alone

GoGuardian was inspired by the belief that **technology can bring responders and communities together**.
By connecting emergency services, community patrols, and support networks, **we can reduce response times and save lives**.

GoGuardian focuses not only on **emergency reaction**, but also **prevention, safety awareness, and empowerment**.
