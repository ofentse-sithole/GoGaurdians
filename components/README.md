# components

Reusable UI components shared across both Business and Personal flows.

## Files

- CommunitySafetyAlerts.js — Displays community safety alerts and notifications
- DirectCommsWithAuth.js — Direct communications UI for authenticated users
- EmergencyButton.js — Primary panic/emergency button component
- EmergencyConatctList.js — Renders a list of emergency contacts
  - Note: Consider renaming to `EmergencyContactList.js` to fix the filename typo

## Usage

Import components here into screens or feature folders rather than duplicating code in feature-specific directories.
