# PersonalUse

End-user (personal) safety flows for the mobile app.

## Subfolders

- Authentication/ — Login, Register, and Forgot Password screens
- Components/ — Components specific to personal user experiences
- LocationSharing/ — Live location and family map-related views
- screens/ — Screen-level containers shown in navigation
- Services/ — Client-side services (AI orchestration, API client)

## Notes

- Prefer common UI from `components/` when possible
- Keep navigation targets in `screens/` and presentational pieces in `Components/`
